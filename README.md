# Repeat-Programming-for-Data-Analysis
This jupyter notebook contains a detailed description of pandas and its usage.
Major Pandas functionalities have been implemented using the iris dataset.

### Pandas is like Excel in Python.
* It is an open source tool for data analysis which conceals all complex calculations.
* It is a Python package which provides quick adaptable and expressive data structures specifically planned to enable working with “relational” or “labeled” data without much effort and easy to understand. Relational data describes data aranged into tables. Labeled data describes the end result after providing headings to data so that it is organised.

### Describing the dataset
Iris dataset was introduced by Ronald Fischer, a british statistician and biologist in 1936. Fischer developed a linear model to distingush the species from each other.

The dataset contains sets of data for 3 varieties of the Iris flower -

* Sentosa
* Versicolor
* Virginica.

50 data readings were collected for these 3 varieties under the following 4 attributes -

* sepal width and sepal length.
* petal width and sepal length.
