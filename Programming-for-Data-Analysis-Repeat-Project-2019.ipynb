    "#### Background of pandas:\n",
    "    \"pandas is like Excel in Python\" [1]. It is an open source tool for data analysis which conceals all complex calculations.\n",
    "    It is a Python package which provides quick adaptable and expressive data structures specifically\n",
    "    planned to enable working with “relational” or “labeled” data without much effort and easy to understand. \n",
    "    \"relational\"data describes data aranged into tables.\n",
    "    \"labeled\" data describes the end result after providing headings to data so that it is organised.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    panda intends to be the under-lying foundation for doing concrete, business-like and practical data analysis in Python. \n",

    "(2) Functionality of pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas is compatible with lots of different types of data. \n",
    "There are two primary data structures of pandas and these accommodate most of the requirements in finance, statistics, social science, and lots of sections of engineering. \n",
    " - Series (1-dimensional) and - DataFrame (2-dimensional).\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary source for scientific computing in Python is NumPy (Numerical Python)[1].\n",
    "As pandas is constructed on top of NumPy, it therefore works well within a scientific computing environment with many other 3rd party libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas performs best with small data (in the range 100MB up to 1GB)[2].\n",
    "\n",
    "?Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns as in an SQL table or Excel spreadsheet\n",
    "Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "?matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and column labels\n",
    "Any other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data actually need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas data structure\n",
    "\n",
    " ?For R users, DataFrame provides everything that R’s data.frame provides and much more. \n",
    " \n",
    " ??? here or later in examples ???\n",
    " Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:\n",
    "#### Primary Funtions:\n",
    " (1) Reading data. \n",
    " \n",
    " Commands or code is: read_csv, read_excel\n",
    " Example of code: data = pd.read_csv('my_file.csv')\n",
    " \n",
    "In addition, it can copy data from Excel or the web. Comands or code:  read_clipboard, read_sql\n",
    "\n",
    " (2) Writing data. \n",
    "Strong import and export tools to load data from flat files (CSV and delimited), databases, files from Excel. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " Commands or code is: .to_excel, .to_json, .to_pickle since .to_csv \n",
    " Example of code: data.to_csv('my_new_file.csv', index=None)\n",
    " \n",
    "In aditions, it allows pasting of results from Python to Excel Comands or code: .to_clipboard\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Checking data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Commands or code is: data.shape\n",
    "data.describe(): This will show the number of rows and columns\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Seeing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Commands or code is: data.head(10). This lists the first 10 rows of data.\n",
    "The similar command data.last(10) lists the last 10 rows of data.\n",
    "These are useful data checks to ensure that the working file is as expected and that no data is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " To print a specific row of the data the command is: data.loc(3) which would print the third row.\n",
    " \n",
    "(5) Logical operations.....\n",
    "The data can be sub divided into different parts based on using logical operations.\n",
    "Therefore use of \"&\" (AND) in code, \"~\" (NOT) and \"|\" (OR), by adding “(“ and “)” before and after the logical operation\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of code: data[(data['column_1']=='french') & (data['year_born']==1990)]\n",
    "This command would return details of individuals was both French and born in 1990.\n",
    "\n",
    "(6) Basic plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic plotting is achieved in pandas using the matplotlib package which is availabel directly in pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Command or code is: .plot\n",
    "Example of code: data['column_numerical'].plot()\n",
    "data['column_numerical'].hist() this displays the output as a histogram\n",
    "\n",
    "(7) Updating the data\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas allow for columns to be deleted and inserted from DataFrame. \n",
    "Example of code: data.loc[10, 'column_1'] = 'irish' This will replace the content of the tenth (10th) row in the column_1 with the word 'irish'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "???? Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data\n",
    "\n",
    "?? Easy handling of missing data (represented as NaN) in floating point as well as non-floating point data\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic and explicit data alignment: objects can be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and let Series, DataFrame, etc. automatically align the data for you in computations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Make it easy to convert ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitive merging and joining data sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per tick)\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, moving window linear regressions, date shifting and lagging, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of these principles are here to address the shortcomings frequently experienced using other languages / scientific research environments. \n",
    "In summary, the transition of data into information usually follows the sequence of data cleansing, modeling \\ analysing it, then formating the results so that they can be plotted or shown in table format. pandas accomodates all these requirements. \n",
